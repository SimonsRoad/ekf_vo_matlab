% What to be loaded:
% Images: I_t, Camera poses: T_t, Camera projection matrix: P_t

% Between each image pairs, compute a dense optical flow 

% Triangulate the get an initial guess

% Q: How to know the quality of the estimated flow
%    (i.e. The initial uncertainty of a 3D point)?
% T: 1. The Semi dense VO paper provides with a potential solution

% Q: How to determine if a point has converged?
% T: 1. Check if the variance drop below a threshold (how about scale
% issue)

% Q: How do manage converged points?
% T: Might want to use a database for fast query etc.
