The noise covariance is important: set to 0 will cause bias; too big will slow down the convergence.
In current setup, cov_w and cov_a are set to 100, whereas stable constants like cov_wb, cov_ab, cov_g0 are set to 0.1

In 'w_only_test.m', covariance update uses P = P-K*H*P instead of P=P-K*S*K as suggested in Mirzaei paper. Now the error stays WELL within the error bound.
